Greenbar is a browser-based server that will run 
nosetests against a specified directory.

It is intended to be used for TDD in Python.  
Write enough of a test to fail, see the red bar.  
Fix the test, see a green bar.  Refactor and 
remove duplication, and continue hacking.  

Unfortunately, Greenbar was not developed using TDD.  
However, its presence will allow my future projects 
to be conceived in less of a state of original sin.
